# SOAR-EDR




## Introduction
Howdy Thank you for taking the time to explore my SOAR-EDR project, which integrates LimaCharlie and Tines. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the critical role of automation in responding to cybersecurity threats in real time.

SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response, while EDR refers to Endpoint Detection and Response. SOAR is an automation platform used by SOC analysts and security professionals to streamline the detection, investigation, and response to incidents within their environment.

The key distinction between SOAR and a traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system, such as Splunk, is that SOAR automates response actions. In a SIEM, analysts typically have to manually take actions, such as quarantining compromised systems or investigating alerts. In contrast, SOAR systems automate many of these tasks, enabling SOC analysts to focus on higher-level activities while improving response time and reducing human error.

Integrating a SOAR system into your security operations enhances overall efficiency, reduces risks, and strengthens the ability to mitigate threats effectively.
